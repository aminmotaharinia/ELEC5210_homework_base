This mechanism enables magnetization manipulation with potentially lower energy consumption, making it an attractive approach for next-generation low-power magnetic memory technologies.\n",

Our objective is to determine the critical voltage required for switching and to analyze how the switching speed and switching probability depend on both the voltage magnitude and pulse duration. This study allows us to understand how dynamically tuning the energy landscape can induce magnetization reversal and how pulse engineering influences deterministic versus probabilistic switching behavior."
